** Abstract
Presented here is a specification of experimental approaches to computer
interaction based on spatial and tangible methods. The report describes an
prototypical implementation of a base system for interaction in space and a
theoretical API for such a system and similar systems. This utilises computer
vision techniques to analyse a surface to track objects and project onto the
space creating a feedback system for interaction. To finish a
ethnomethodological framework for evaluation and further development is
proposed???
