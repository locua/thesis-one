* Group writing session -                                          :noexport:

** Today: 
Outline background research and
** So far 
Only the main structure is in place
** By the end of the session:
Have written a good overview of literature sorted out main references and cited
them
** First 45 mins
Identify main references and begin writing. Describing background research and
academic context for the project.

* Introduction
* Background

The motivation for this project stems in part from a feeling of frustration in
how working on computers can often be a constricted affair and a pondering over
how we might expand the /keyboard-mouse-monitor/ model to improve the utility of
computers regarding our own perceptive abilities. How might a spatial and more
/haptic/ environment for interaction create an improved space for thinking with
computers as well as our physical health.

*** Theories of embodiment in HCI
*** Haptic interfaces
"the widgets cannot provide the haptic response that physical objects do when
touched or clicked. By adding haptic feedback to user interfaces, we can
recreate the physical sensation of pressing a button, holding a ball or even
create completely new touch sensations."
