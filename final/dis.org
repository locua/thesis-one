** Today: 
Outline background research and
** So far 
Only the main structure is in place
** By the end of the session:
Have written a good overview of literature sorted out main references and cited
them
** First 45 mins
Identify main references and begin writing. Describing background research and
academic context for the project.

* Introduction
* Background

The motivation for this project stems in part from a feeling of frustration in
how working on computers can often be a constricted affair and a pondering over
how we might expand the /keyboard-mouse-monitor/ model to improve the utility of
computers regarding our own perceptive abilities. How might a spatial and more
/haptic/ environment for interaction create an improved space for thinking with
computers as well as our physical health.

** Definitions
*** Computing
*** keyboard-mouse-monitor model (kmm model) (?)

** Original ideas with exocortexes; Externalised memory and organisational systems

*** Org mode and nataniev ecosystem

** Dynamicland

One of my original points of reference was /Dynamicland/, a research project in
Oakland, USA. The aim of the project is to implement a new more powerful and
accessible model of computing.

#+begin_quote

In Oakland, we built the first full-scale realization of the vision, inviting
thousands of people into our space to collaborate. Together, these artists,
scientists, teachers, students, programmers, and non-programmers created
hundreds of projects that would have been impossible anywhere else.

#+end_quote

/Dynamicland/ is a communal computer where the building is the computer (a
transition back in scale to the days of the first computers ENIAC). Programs are
embodied in the room on pieces of colour-coded paper. The programs are
recognised via the codes and their code, stored in a database is then run. It
can also /read/ code using OCR but generally the code is there [[https://thenewstack.io/dynamicland-rethinks-computer-interfaces/][symbolically]].

** mental and physical health implications of contemporary computing ? Are they really quite minor?

** Computational creativity?

"the widgets cannot provide the haptic response that physical objects do when
touched or clicked. By adding haptic feedback to user interfaces, we can
recreate the physical sensation of pressing a button, holding a ball or even
create completely new touch sensations."
