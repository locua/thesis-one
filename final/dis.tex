\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:orgbbdfea8}

The motivation for this project stems in part from a feeling of frustration in
how working on computers can often be a constricted affair and a pondering over
how we might expand the \emph{keyboard-mouse-monitor} model to improve the utility of
computers regarding our own perceptive abilities. How might a spatial and more
\emph{haptic} environment for interaction create an improved space for thinking with
computers as well as our physical health.

\section{Dynamicland}
\label{sec:org8edbb77}

One of my original points of reference was \emph{Dynamicland}, a research project in
Oakland, USA. The aim of the project is to implement a new more powerful and
accessible model of computing.

\begin{quote}


In Oakland, we built the first full-scale realization of the vision, inviting
thousands of people into our space to collaborate. Together, these artists,
scientists, teachers, students, programmers, and non-programmers created
hundreds of projects that would have been impossible anywhere else.
-- Dynamicland.org 
\end{quote}


\emph{Dynamicland} is a communal computer where the building is the computer (ENIAC).
Programs are embodied in the room on pieces of colour-coded paper. The programs
are recognised via the codes and their code, stored in a database is then run,
it can also \emph{read} code using OCR but generally the code is there \href{https://thenewstack.io/dynamicland-rethinks-computer-interfaces/}{symbolically}.
Projectors on the ceiling transform the paper and workbenches into whatever the
programmer decides. This relatively simple model makes for an exciting new
ecosystem for collaborative computing and expressive programming. Victors,
highlights his ideas for the progression of computing and interaction in a
series of talks (available online) and on his \href{http://worrydream.com}{website}. In his talk "Seeing
Spaces" he talks of a new kind of maker-space which allow makers to see across
time and possibilities. \emph{Dynamicland} offers a computational medium which allows
for full use of the human senses for the exploration with of "\href{https://vimeo.com/115154289}{humane
representation[s] of thought}". \cite{VictorKayDynamicLand} \\

\emph{Dynamicland} was the inspiration for the main physical and technical model for
this project, an \emph{augmented} workspace either on the floor or a table which is
projected onto. A camera/s pointing down onto the projection space is the sensor
for detecting interaction, with the projector as the actuator. This model can be
seen in the Figure \ref{pp-schema}  .
