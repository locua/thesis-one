abstract = {<p>There is a problem in the spatial and temporal separation between the varying forms of representation used in urban design. Sketches, physical models, and more recently computational simulation, while each serving a useful purpose, tend to be incompatible forms of representation. The contemporary designer is required assimilate these divergent media into a single mental construct and in so doing is distracted from the central process of design. We propose an augmented reality workbench called "Luminous Table" that attempts to address this issue by integrating multiple forms of physical and digital representations. 2D drawings, 3D physical models, and digital simulation are overlaid into a single information space in order to support the urban design process. We describe how the system was used in a graduate design course and discuss how the simultaneous use of physical and digital media allowed for a more holistic design approach. We also discuss the need for future technical improvements.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>This study proposes a novel method for facilitating product design that persuades users to have more bodily movements for both health and energy harvesting by using concepts of case-based reasoning. A domain knowledge model for case-based reasoning is proposed to explain how design and technology can help persuade users to perform target behavior. There are five groups of attributes in the model including target behavior, design principles, design techniques, applicable technology, and users’ motives and ability. With the model, knowledge from more than 98 cases are extracted to form a case library. To find better persuasive means for different user groups, significant users’ motives and ability are identified for different target users by using regression models which result from a questionnaire survey of local potential users. A case-based method with a six-step procedure is proposed to find some useful suggestions from retrieved cases by specifying target users and target behaviors. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the application potential of the proposed method.</p>},
